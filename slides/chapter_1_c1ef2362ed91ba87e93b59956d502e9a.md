Hi, there! My name is Florin Angelescu and we will be learning together about SQL Server triggers throughout this course.
I am very excited that we are able to do this together and we will be doing a lot of real world code samples together.
Let’s start by finding out what exactly a trigger is and how it may help us in our day to day tasks.

## What is a trigger?

```yaml

`@script`
A SQL Server trigger is a special type of stored procedure which is automatically executed when an event occurs in the database server.

## Types of triggers

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "b178d016ac"
```

`@part1`
- Data Manipulation Language (DML) triggers
   - INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE statements
- Data Definition Language (DDL) triggers
   - CREATE, ALTER or DROP statements
- Logon triggers
   - LOGON statement


`@script`
There are two main categories of triggers based on the SQL code classification used.

Data Manipulation Language triggers are being executed when a user or process tries to modify data through an INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE statement. As you can see, these triggers are associated with statements related to tables or views.

Data Definition Language triggers are being executed when a user or process calls pieces of code involving statements like CREATE, ALTER or DROP. These triggers are related to various database or server objects.

A special class or triggers contains the logon triggers which are used in response to LOGON events when a user’s session is being established.

We will be covering all these types of triggers with more details in later chapters.
