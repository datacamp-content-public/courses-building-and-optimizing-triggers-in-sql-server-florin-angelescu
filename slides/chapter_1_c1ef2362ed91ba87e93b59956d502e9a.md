SQL Server instructor at DataCamp


`@script`
Hi, there! My name is Florin Angelescu and we will be learning together about SQL Server triggers throughout this course.
I am very excited that we are able to do this together and we will be doing a lot of real world code samples together.
Let’s start by finding out what exactly a trigger is and how it may help us in our day to day tasks.

## What is a trigger?

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "6939a6c260"
center_content: false
```

`@part1`
- special type of stored procedure
- executed when an event occurs in the database server

`@script`
A SQL Server trigger is a special type of stored procedure which is automatically executed when an event occurs in the database server.


---
## Types of triggers

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "b178d016ac"
```

`@part1`
- Data Manipulation Language (DML) triggers
   - INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE statements
- Data Definition Language (DDL) triggers
   - CREATE, ALTER or DROP statements
- Logon triggers
   - LOGON statement


`@script`
There are two main categories of triggers based on the SQL code classification used.

Data Manipulation Language triggers are being executed when a user or process tries to modify data through an INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE statement. As you can see, these triggers are associated with statements related to tables or views.

Data Definition Language triggers are being executed when a user or process calls pieces of code involving statements like CREATE, ALTER or DROP. These triggers are related to various database or server objects.

A special class or triggers contains the logon triggers which are used in response to LOGON events when a user’s session is being established.

We will be covering all these types of triggers with more details in later chapters.

## Trigger usage

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "d7ca91e08d"
```

`@part1`
- AFTER trigger
 - Rebuild an index after a large insert
 - Notify the admin when data is updated
- INSTEAD OF trigger
 - Prevent data manipulation


`@script`
Another important characteristic of SQL Server triggers is their outcome in response to an event.

We can use a AFTER trigger when we want to execute a piece of code as a result of another statement being executed.
We can use an AFTER trigger to rebuild an index table after a large amount of data was inserted in a certain table.
Another example is sending an e-mail to the database administrator whenever UPDATE statements are executed against a certain table.

There are plenty of examples for their use cases and will later learn how to determine situations when an AFTER trigger is the best option to use.

The other type of trigger we can use is the INSTEAD OF trigger. As the name suggests, this trigger doesn’t perform the initial action that fired the trigger. Instead, it can execute a custom piece of code created by us which replaces the initial intended statement.
A common example for using this trigger is to prevent inserting data to a certain table, or updates, even removing data.
As before, we can also notify database administrators for abnormal behavior, but this time we can also prevent the statement from being executed.

## Options for creating triggers

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "425eb1c7ba"
```

`@part1`
- T-SQL
- Common Language Runtime (CLR)


`@script`
Now that we have a good comprehension of what triggers are, let’s see how we can create them.
Because this course focuses on using T-SQL code, we will be looking only to the T-SQL approach on creating triggers.
But it’s worth mentioning that triggers can also be created from methods of assemblies that are created in the Microsoft .NET Framework common language runtime (CLR) and uploaded to an instance of SQL Server.

## Creating triggers

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "0e17361ff2"
```

`@part1`
{{`CREATE TRIGGER`}}


`@script`
We already mentioned that a trigger is a special type of stored procedure and implicitly a SQL Server object.
We can add a new trigger by using the CREATE TRIGGER statement. This statement is similar to the CREATE INDEX statement.
This means that we will have to attach it to an existing object that can be a table, view, database or server.
We will be covering all these examples throughout the course, so for now we will just consider an existing table called [dbo].[Customers].
The next part of the statement will be the outcome related to the event. We will use an AFTER trigger for this example.
The AS keyword marks the actual beginning of our trigger workflow. This is where we will insert our code logic for the trigger.
