`@script`
Hi, and welcome to my course!

My name is Florin Angelescu and we will be learning together about SQL Server triggers.

After taking this course together, you will feel confident implementing and using triggers in your day-to-day tasks.

## What is a trigger?

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "6939a6c260"
center_content: false
```

`@part1`
- special type of stored procedure {{1}}
- executed when an event occurs in the database server {{2}}

`@script`
A trigger is a special type of stored procedure which is automatically executed when an event occurs in the database server.

## Types of triggers

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "b178d016ac"
```

`@part1`
- Data Manipulation Language (DML) triggers {{1}}
   - INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE statements {{2}}
- Data Definition Language (DDL) triggers {{3}}
   - CREATE, ALTER or DROP statements {{4}}
- Logon triggers {{5}}
   - LOGON statement {{6}}


`@script`
There are two main types of triggers based on the T-SQL code they respond to.

Data Manipulation Language triggers are executed when a user or process tries to modify data through an INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE statement.
This type of triggers is associated with statements related to tables or views.

Data Definition Language triggers are executed when a piece of code involving statements like CREATE, ALTER or DROP is called.
These triggers are related to various database or server objects.

A third type of triggers are the logon triggers. They are used in response to LOGON events when a userâ€™s session is being established.

We will be covering all these types of triggers in more depth in later chapters.

## Trigger usage

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "d7ca91e08d"
```

`@part1`
- AFTER trigger {{1}}
 - Rebuild an index after a large insert {{2}}
 - Notify the admin when data is updated {{3}}
- INSTEAD OF trigger {{4}}
 - Prevent data manipulation {{5}}


`@script`
Another important characteristic of SQL Server triggers is their outcome while responding to the triggering event.

We can use an AFTER trigger when we want to execute a piece of code as a result of another statement being executed.

We can use an AFTER trigger to rebuild an index table after a large amount of data was inserted in a table.
We can send an e-mail to the database administrator whenever UPDATE statements are executed against another table.

There are plenty of examples for their use cases and you will learn how to determine the best triggers to use a little later in this course.

The other type of trigger we can use is the INSTEAD OF trigger. As the name suggests, this trigger does not perform the initial action that fired it. Instead, it can execute a custom piece of code that replaces the initial intended statement.

A common example for using this trigger is to prevent inserting data to a table, prevent updates or even prevent removing data.
As before, we can also notify database administrator for suspicious behavior, but this time we also prevent the statement from being executed.

## Options for creating triggers

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "425eb1c7ba"
```

`@part1`
- T-SQL {{1}}
- Common Language Runtime (CLR) {{2}}


`@script`
Because this course focuses on using T-SQL code, we will be looking only to the T-SQL approach on creating triggers.

However, it is worth mentioning that triggers can also be created from methods of assemblies that are created in the Microsoft .NET Framework common language runtime (CLR) and uploaded to an instance of SQL Server.

## Creating triggers

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "0e17361ff2"
```

`@part1`
`CREATE TRIGGER [TRG_AFT_INS_Customer]` {{1}}

`ON [dbo].[Customer]` {{2}}

`AFTER INSERT` {{3}}

`AS` {{4}}

`{trigger_logic}` {{5}}


`@script`
We know by now a trigger is a special type of stored procedure and implicitly a SQL Server object.
This means we can add a new trigger by using a CREATE statement - in this case it will be CREATE TRIGGER statement. We also give it a name.
Similar to index behavior, we will have to attach the trigger to an existing object that can be a table, view, database or server.
For now we will just consider an existing table called [dbo].[Customer].
The next part will be the outcome related to the event that invokes the trigger. We will use an AFTER trigger for this example.
The AS keyword marks the actual beginning of our trigger workflow. This is where we will insert our code logic for the trigger.

## Why should we use triggers?

```yaml
type: "FinalSlide"
key: "b713e97761"
```

`@script`
Let's proceed to the next lesson and find out why we should use triggers in certain scenarios.
